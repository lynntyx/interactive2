	<p>Killer whales Micheline Jenner</p>

	<p>
	As the name entails
	Are partial to mammals
	Especially other animals

	Deer and seals
	All become meals
	Also white shark
	Reality quite stark

	Top ocean predator
	A killing pre-meditator
	Kills efficient
	Not complacent

	Tall dorsal pose
	Brings ocean of prose
	Life at sea
	Efficiently

	Close knit family
	All related genetically
	Range afar
	As pantry ajar
	Seeing takeaway meals
	Plays with seals

	Kind side of matriarch
	Young calves play the lark
	Frolic in the open ocean
	Dorsal strong with constant motion

	Hope to see black dorsals tall
	Now we've seen your signals small
	Intriguing sound
	On Sonix found

	Not complex
	Small intonation flex
	We seek the lion of the sea
	A truly oceanic beasty
