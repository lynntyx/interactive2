	<h1>Killer whales</h1>
	<h6>Micheline Jenner</h6>
	<br>
	
	<p>As the name entails/ 
	Are partial to mammals/ 
	Especially other animals</p>
	<br>
	
	<p>Deer and seals/ 
	All become meals/ 
	Also white shark/ 
	Reality quite stark</p>
	<br>
	
	<p>Top ocean predator/ 
	A killing pre-meditator/ 
	Kills efficient/ 
	Not complacent</p>
	<br>
	
	<p>Tall dorsal pose/ 
	Brings ocean of prose/ 
	Life at sea/ 
	Efficiently</p>
	<br>
	<p>Close knit family/ 
	All related genetically/ 
	Range afar/ 
	As pantry ajar/ 
	Seeing takeaway meals/ 
	Plays with seals</p>
	<br>

	<p>Kind side of matriarch/ 
	Young calves play the lark/ 
	Frolic in the open ocean/ 
	Dorsal strong with constant motion</p>
	<br>

	<p>Hope to see black dorsals tall/ 
	Now we've seen your signals small/ 
	Intriguing sound/ 
	On Sonix found</p>
	<br>

	<p>Not complex/ 
	Small intonation flex/ 
	We seek the lion of the sea/ 
	A truly oceanic beasty</p>
