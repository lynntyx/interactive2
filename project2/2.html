	<p>Killer whales</p>
	<p>Micheline Jenner</p>

	<p>
	As the name entails
	Are partial to mammals
	Especially other animals
	<br>
	Deer and seals
	All become meals
	Also white shark
	Reality quite stark
	<br>
	Top ocean predator
	A killing pre-meditator
	Kills efficient
	Not complacent
	<br>
	Tall dorsal pose
	Brings ocean of prose
	Life at sea
	Efficiently
	<br>
	Close knit family
	All related genetically
	Range afar
	As pantry ajar
	Seeing takeaway meals
	Plays with seals
	<br>
	Kind side of matriarch
	Young calves play the lark
	Frolic in the open ocean
	Dorsal strong with constant motion
	<br>
	Hope to see black dorsals tall
	Now we've seen your signals small
	Intriguing sound
	On Sonix found
	<br>
	Not complex
	Small intonation flex
	We seek the lion of the sea
	A truly oceanic beasty
