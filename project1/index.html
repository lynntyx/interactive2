		<p>
		Sunday's coming i wanna drive my car
		<br>
		to your apartment with a present like a star
		<br>
		forecaster said the weathers may be rainy hard
		<br>
		but i know the sun will shine for us
		<br>
		oh lazy seagull fly me from the dark
		<br>
		i dress my jeans and feed my monkey banana
		<br>
		then i think my age how old,skyline how far
		<br>
		where we need each other in california
