			Sunday's coming i wanna drive my car<br>
			to your apartment with a present like a star<br>
			forecaster said the weathers may be rainy hard<br>
			but i know the sun will shine for us<br>
			<br>
			oh lazy seagull fly me from the dark<br>
			i dress my jeans and feed my monkey banana<br>
			then i think my age how old,skyline how far<br>
			where we need each other in california<br>
			<br>
			you show me your body before night comes down<br>
			i touch your face and promise to stay ever young<br>
			on this ivory beach we kissed so long<br>
			it seems that the passion's never gone<br>
			<br>
			you sing me your melody and i feel so please<br>
			i want you to want me to keep your dream<br>
			together we'll run wild by a summer symphony<br>
			this is what we enjoyed not a fantasy<br>
			<br>
			the tin-man's surfing i wanna try my luck<br>
			to the top of tide rip like just have some drugs<br>
			i know you have no blame for my proud moonish heart<br>
			welcome to the golden beatnik park<br>
			<br>
			oh diamond seashore drag me from the yard<br>
			incredible sunward i watch as you're in photograph<br>
			for camera your smile's so sweet,palm trees' so lush<br>
			would you believe my honey it's califonia<br>
